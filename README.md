# Chainscale: a project to scale blockchains to support all the world's financial transactions

As a substrate for a financial and bureaucratic system, blockchains have important advantages: they
allow anyone with a computer to participate in the system, they allow transactions to be audited
so that everyone can know that the rules of the system are being followed, and they aren't dependent
on centralized parties that could commit fraud or otherwise sabotage the system.

The most popular blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not scalable.  They require every
full node to download and verify every transaction.
